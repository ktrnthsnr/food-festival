# service worker notes 

Steps completed to add the service worker

1. To test locally, I installed dev-server, an already HTTPS-enabled development server, (so the app can be viewed before deploying to prod, without instantiating a server such as Express.js or w/o adding HTTPS to the application).
`npm i webpack-dev-server -D`

2. updated package.json scripts
  "start:dev": "webpack-dev-server"

3. added script to the index.html

    <script>
        (function() {if("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
            navigator.serviceWorker.register("./service-worker.js")
            .then(() => console.log("Service Worker registered successfully."))
            .catch(error => console.log("Service Worker registration failed:", error));
        }})();
    </script>

4. created service-worker.js on the root. Add the code to install the service worker, including adding files to precache, event listeners, and then you are ready to test and use.

5. started the dev server with this command `npm run start:dev` 

6. browsed on localhost:8080 

7. checked if the files added in service-worker.js were cached: under browser Chrome DevTools > Application tab > Cache Storage

If caching the right side should look like this: img\ServiceWorkerCacheStorage.jpg
